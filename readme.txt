When the user starts the application it will go to the google map with the user’s location pinned and zoom in. The user can browse through the map and see other people location’s pinned on the map if they exists in the cloud mine’s database. When the user click on any of the pin, it will display a description or name of who’s pin it belongs to. On the top right hand corner, there is a drop down menu named “Find Friends”. 

When the user clicked on the “Find Friends” button, it will take him/her to the next activity which composed of two spinners. The first one is minutes and the second spinner is distance. The user have the ability to select or search for all friends who, within the last N minutes, were within X miles of your posted location. Right below the spinners are a list view displaying a list to the user of those people who are currently around you. Long-pressing on the user will send an email or in-app message to that user to inform them that you are "nearby."

I used Google map and Google distance matrix API to get the map and get the distance in mile between the current user and their friends. I also used cloud mine as my backend and database to store the person objects. I also used okhttp3 which is a HTTP & HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications. Google Play Services which is a Google-powered features such as Google Maps.Lastly, Gson which is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation.
